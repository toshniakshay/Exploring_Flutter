# Exploring flutter

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
This will have a small use case covering Stateless, stateful widgets, Routing, Dialogs, Lists, SharedPreferences, Local Caching, API Calls and what not..


A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

COMING SOON---
Will be adding those features branchwise
